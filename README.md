# GPT Hardware (gpthardware)

The goal of this project is to develop tools that enable the creation of more secure hardware.


## We're building safer hardware.

There are various approaches to AI-based hardware trojan detection, including:

- Side-channel analysis: AI algorithms can be trained to analyze side-channel information, such as power consumption, electromagnetic emissions, or timing information, to identify potential hardware trojans.

- Layout and design analysis: Machine learning techniques can be used to examine the layout and design of integrated circuits, looking for patterns or anomalies that may indicate the presence of a hardware trojan.

- Simulation and testing: AI algorithms can be employed to simulate the behavior of electronic components under various conditions and analyze the results for indications of hardware trojans.
